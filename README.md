## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\```
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link/personalized-ethical-alignment.git
\```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
\```
cd personalized-ethical-alignment
\```
3. Install the required dependencies (assuming pip is used):
\```
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

## Usage

1. **Generating Answers**:
   - Use `baseline.py` to generate the answer JSON file for the questions specified in `questions.py`.
     \```
     python baseline.py
     \```

2. **Evaluating GPT-4**:
   - Use `gpt4_eval.py` to evaluate the answers generated by GPT-4. You need to specify the filename of the answer file.
     \```
     python gpt4_eval.py -file_name your_answer_filename.json
     \```
   - This will generate evaluation statistics in a `stats.json` file.

3. **Fine-Tuning and Evaluation for Specific Age Groups**:
   - Use `lora_llama_{age_group}.py` to run the generated answers for fine-tuned models specific to a particular age group. Replace `{age_group}` with the desired age group, e.g., `lora_llama_teen.py` for teenagers.
     \```
     python lora_llama_teen.py
     \```
